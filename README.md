# 🌸 Florell Perfumes — Personalized Fragrances

This is a simple yet elegant website that I created together with my friend [@HarithaRathakrishnan](https://github.com/HarithaRathakrishnan) as part of our **Entrepreneurship** course project.  

Our concept revolves around starting a **perfume startup** that focuses on **personalized scents** crafted to match each customer’s **MBTI personality type**. The idea was to blend the art of perfumery with the science of personality profiling, creating fragrances that truly *"Speak You"*.

We wanted to go beyond “just perfumes” and create an **experience** — one where customers feel deeply connected to their fragrance because it resonates with their personality traits, lifestyle, and preferences.
